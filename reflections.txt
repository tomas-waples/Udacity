You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  
* What new skills have you learned?
  

	Mostly how to use outside resources, like Stack Overflow and MDN, efficiently.

* What has been easy?
  

	Basic organization and keeping clear where I am in the process of turning the mark up over into a working page

* What has been difficult?
  

	Not getting frustrated when the first fifteen things I try don’t work.

* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

	At the risk of sounding clichéd, the importance of “keep calm and carry on”
